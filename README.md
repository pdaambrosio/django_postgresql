# Lab Django with PostgreSQL

This lab runs on the Heroku cloud.
However, it can also be executed locally with some changes described below, using PostgreSQL in a container, creating a volume to persist the data.

It is necessary to have docker and docker-compose installed to run the "postgres_compose.yaml" file.

More information about installing both is at the links below.:

[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Requirements

* Docker, Docker Compose and Django for local deployment
* Create an account at [heroku.com](https://www.heroku.com/)
* install Heroku CLI

## Heroku CLI

For more information on how to install Heroku see this [link](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install), but basically the command below can be used.

```

If you need to install the snap, see the official documentation... [snapcraft](https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snapd)
